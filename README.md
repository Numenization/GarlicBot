## What does GarlicBot do?
I dunno some cool stuff.
Some stuff it currently supports:
- Echo command: barks stuff back at the user
- Roll command: rolls an N sided die
- Quote system:
  - Save the last message sent in a text channel as a quote for later
  - Manually enter a quote with an author and content
  - Get a random quote from the database and send it as a message to the text channel
